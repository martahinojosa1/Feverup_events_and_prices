# Feverup_events_and_prices

Analysis and research project - Feverup (event trends and prices).

In this repository, you will find two studies:

Analysis of data on the trends and types of most popular leisure events through a real search app (Feverup).
Analysis of prices and earnings according to events (Feverup).
Both databases are samples of events from 4 countries (USA, Canada, Great Britain, and Ireland).

Live Application!
